#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID) from "BIT_DB".JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> "Order ID"
AND orderID <> ""; 


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(orderID) from "BIT_DB".JanSales 
WHERE Product = "iPhone" AND
length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> "Order ID"; 

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select distinct(acctnum) from "BIT_DB".customers customers
INNER JOIN "BIT_DB".FebSales Feb_sales 
ON customers.order_id = Feb_sales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select product, min(price) minimum
from "BIT_DB".JanSales
group by product, price
order by minimum asc
limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product from "BIT_DB".JanSales
where OrderID <> "Order ID" and length(orderID) = 6
group by product, price;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum(quantity),product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue from "BIT_DB".FebSales 
where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select Count(distinct(cust.acctnum)), avg(quantity)*price as average 
from "BIT_DB".FebSales feb 
left JOIN "BIT_DB".customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
where feb.Quantity > 2 and
OrderID <> "Order ID" and length(orderID) = 6;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select product, location, sum(quantity)
